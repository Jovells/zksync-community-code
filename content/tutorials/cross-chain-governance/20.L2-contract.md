description: Deploy a contract in ZKsync that has a counter.

## L2 Counter

Now that we have an address for the L1 governance contract, we can build, deploy, and test the counter contract on L2.

1. `cd` out of `L1-governance` and initialize the `L2-counter` project:

    ```sh
    npx zksync-cli create L2-counter --template hardhat_solidity
    ```

    ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    In case of any issues on this step (f.e. you did not have a yarn), you may get
    errors during the recreation of the project environment.
    Clean your current environment in advance or create another folder and create environment there.
    ::

1. For the purposes of this tutorial, we don't need the Greeter related files generated by the ZKsync-CLI.
  Proceed with removing `Greeter.sol` from our `/contracts` directory:

    ```sh
    rm -rf ./contracts/Greeter.sol
    ```

1. Similarly, remove the deploy scripts associated with the Greeter contract:

    ```sh
    rm -rf ./deploy/deploy-greeter.ts && rm -rf ./deploy/use-greeter.ts
    ```

### Create L2 Counter Contract

1. In the `L2-counter/contracts/` directory, create a new file `Counter.sol`.

    This contract contains the address of the governance contract deployed previously on layer 1, and an incrementable
  counter which can only be invoked by the governance contract.

1. Copy/paste the following code into the file:

    ```solidity [Counter.sol]
    // SPDX-License-Identifier: Unlicense

    pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

    contract Counter {
        uint256 public value = 0;
        address public governance;

        constructor(address newGovernance) {
            governance = newGovernance;
        }

        function increment() public {
            require(msg.sender == governance, "Only governance is allowed");

            value += 1;
        }
    }
    ```

1. Compile the contract from the `L2-counter` root:

    ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    Compilations happens only after the installation of a compiler.
    ::

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx hardhat compile
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn hardhat compile
    ```

    ::

### Deploy L2 Counter Contract

1. Copy/paste the following code into `L2-counter/deploy/deploy.ts`, replacing `<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>` with the address
   of the Governance contract we just deployed, and `<WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY>` with your private key:

    ```typescript [L2-counter/deploy/deploy.ts]
    import { utils, Wallet } from "zksync-ethers";
    import { HardhatRuntimeEnvironment } from "hardhat/types";
    import { Deployer } from "@matterlabs/hardhat-zksync-deploy";
    // load env file
    import dotenv from "dotenv";
    dotenv.config();

    // Insert the address of the governance contract
    const GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS = "<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>";

    // An example of a deploy script that will deploy and call a simple contract.
    export default async function (hre: HardhatRuntimeEnvironment) {
      console.log(`Running deploy script for the Counter contract`);

      const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY || "";
      if (!PRIVATE_KEY) throw "⛔️ Private key not detected! Add it to the .env file!";
      // Initialize the wallet.
      const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY);

      // Create deployer object and load the artifact of the contract you want to deploy.
      const deployer = new Deployer(hre, wallet);
      const artifact = await deployer.loadArtifact("Counter");

      // Deploy this contract. The returned object will be of a `Contract` type, similar to the ones in `ethers`.
      // The address of the governance is an argument for contract constructor.
      const counterContract = await deployer.deploy(artifact, [utils.applyL1ToL2Alias(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS)]);

      const receipt = await counterContract.deploymentTransaction()?.wait();

      // Show the contract info.
      const contractAddress = receipt?.contractAddress;
      console.log(`${artifact.contractName} was deployed to ${contractAddress}`);
    }
    ```

    ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    The deployment script contains a deposit from Sepolia to %%zk_testnet_name%%, which can take a few minutes to finish.
    If your wallet already has funds in L2, you can skip that part to save you some time.
    ::

1. Now deploy the contract from the `L2-counter/` folder root to ZKsync:

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx hardhat deploy-zksync
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn hardhat deploy-zksync
    ```

    ::

    You should see output like this:

    ```txt
    Running deploy script for the Counter contract
    Counter was deployed to 0x3c5A6AB2390F6217C78d2F6F403A9dFb7e7784FC

    ```

## Read the Counter Value

Now both contracts are deployed, we can create a script to retrieve the value of the counter.

1. Create the `scripts` directory under `L2-counter`.

1. Copy the `abi` array from the compilation artifact located at
   `/L2-counter/artifacts-zk/contracts/Counter.sol/Counter.json`.

1. Create a new file `/L2-counter/scripts/counter.json` and paste in the `abi` array.

1. Create a `/L2-counter/scripts/display-value.ts` file and paste in the following code, adding the counter contract
   address:

    ```ts [L2-counter/scripts/display-value.ts]
    import { Contract, Provider } from "zksync-ethers";

    const COUNTER_ADDRESS = "<COUNTER-ADDRESS>";
    const COUNTER_ABI = require("./counter.json");

    async function main() {
      // Initialize the provider
      const l2Provider = new Provider("https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev");

      const counterContract = new Contract(COUNTER_ADDRESS, COUNTER_ABI, l2Provider);

      const value = (await counterContract.value()).toString();

      console.log(`The counter value is ${value}`);
    }

    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exitCode = 1;
    });
    ```

1. Run the script:

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    ::

    The output should be:

    ```txt
    The counter value is 0
    ```

## Call L2 Contract from L1

Now, let's call the `increment` method on Layer 2 from Layer 1.

1. Copy the `abi` array from the compilation artifact located at:

    `/L1-governance/artifacts/contracts/Governance.sol/Governance.json`.

    You have to copy only abi content from the file after the keyword abi, an example below:

    ```json
    [
      {
        "inputs": [
          {
            "internalType": "address",
            "name": "newGovernance",
            "type": "address"
          }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "constructor"
      },
      {
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "governance",
        "outputs": [
          {
            "internalType": "address",
            "name": "",
            "type": "address"
          }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
      },
      {
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "increment",
        "outputs": [],
        "stateMutability": "nonpayable",
        "type": "function"
      },
      {
        "inputs": [],
        "name": "value",
        "outputs": [
          {
            "internalType": "uint256",
            "name": "",
            "type": "uint256"
          }
        ],
        "stateMutability": "view",
        "type": "function"
      }
    ]
    ```

1. Paste it into a new file: `/L2-counter/scripts/governance.json`.

1. Create the `L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts` file and paste in the following code, replacing the following
   details:

    - GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L1.
    - COUNTER-ADDRESS: the address of the contract deployed in L2.
    - WALLET-PRIVATE-KEY: the private key of your account.
    - RPC-URL: the same url you used in the `sepolia.json` file.

    ```ts [L2-counter/scripts/increment-counter.ts]
    import { Contract, Wallet, Interface } from "ethers";
    import { Provider, utils } from "zksync-ethers";
    // load env file
    import dotenv from "dotenv";
    dotenv.config();

    const GOVERNANCE_ABI = require("./governance.json");
    const GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS = "<GOVERNANCE-ADDRESS>";
    const COUNTER_ABI = require("./counter.json");
    const COUNTER_ADDRESS = "<COUNTER-ADDRESS>";

    const PRIVATE_KEY = process.env.WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY || "";
    if (!PRIVATE_KEY) throw "⛔️ Private key not detected! Add it to the .env file!";
    // Initialize the wallet.

    async function main() {
      // Enter your Ethereum L1 provider RPC URL.
      const l1Provider = new Provider("<L1-RPC-URL>");
      // Set up the Governor wallet to be the same as the one that deployed the governance contract.
      const wallet = new Wallet(PRIVATE_KEY, l1Provider);
      // Set a constant that accesses the Layer 1 contract.
      const govcontract = new Contract(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS, GOVERNANCE_ABI, wallet);

      // Initialize the L2 provider.
      const l2Provider = new Provider("https://sepolia.era.zksync.dev");
      // Get the current address of the ZKsync L1 bridge.
      const zkSyncAddress = await l2Provider.getMainContractAddress();
      // Get the `Contract` object of the ZKsync bridge.
      const zkSyncContract = new Contract(zkSyncAddress, utils.ZKSYNC_MAIN_ABI, wallet);

      // Encoding the L1 transaction is done in the same way as it is done on Ethereum.
      // Use an Interface which gives access to the contract functions.
      const counterInterface = new Interface(COUNTER_ABI);
      const data = counterInterface.encodeFunctionData("increment", []);

      // The price of an L1 transaction depends on the gas price used.
      // You should explicitly fetch the gas price before making the call.
      const gasPrice = await l1Provider.getGasPrice();

      // Define a constant for gas limit which estimates the limit for the L1 to L2 transaction.
      const gasLimit = await l2Provider.estimateL1ToL2Execute({
        contractAddress: COUNTER_ADDRESS,
        calldata: data,
        caller: utils.applyL1ToL2Alias(GOVERNANCE_ADDRESS),
      });
      // baseCost takes the price and limit and formats the total in wei.
      // For more information on `REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT` see the [fee model documentation](../developer-guides/transactions/fee-model.md).
      const baseCost = await zkSyncContract.l2TransactionBaseCost(gasPrice, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT);

      // !! If you don't include the gasPrice and baseCost in the transaction, a re-estimation of fee may generate errors.
      const tx = await govcontract.callZkSync(zkSyncAddress, COUNTER_ADDRESS, data, gasLimit, utils.REQUIRED_L1_TO_L2_GAS_PER_PUBDATA_LIMIT, {
        // Pass the necessary ETH `value` to cover the fee for the operation
        value: baseCost,
        gasPrice,
      });

      // Wait until the L1 tx is complete.
      await tx.wait();

      // Get the TransactionResponse object for the L2 transaction corresponding to the execution call.
      const l2Response = await l2Provider.getL2TransactionFromPriorityOp(tx);

      // Output the receipt of the L2 transaction corresponding to the call to the counter contract.
      const l2Receipt = await l2Response.wait();
      console.log(l2Receipt);
    }

    // We recommend always using this async/await pattern to properly handle errors.
    main().catch((error) => {
      console.error(error);
      process.exitCode = 1;
    });
    ```

    ::callout{icon="i-heroicons-light-bulb"}
    Executing transactions from L1 requires the caller to pay a fee to the L2 operator.
    The fee depends on the length of the calldata and the `gasLimit`.
    This is similar to the `gasLimit` on Ethereum.
    The fee also depends on the gas price that is used during the transaction call.
    So to have a predictable fee for the call, the gas price should be fetched from the L1 provider.
    ::

1. Run the script with the following command:

    ::code-group

    ```sh [npm]
    npx ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ```sh [yarn]
    yarn ts-node ./scripts/increment-counter.ts
    ```

    ::

    In the output, you should see the full transaction receipt in L2.
    You can take the `transactionHash` and track it in the [ZKsync explorer](https://sepolia.explorer.zksync.io/).
    It should look something like this:

    ```json
    {
      to: '0x9b379893bfAD08c12C2167C3e3dBf591BeD9410a',

      contractAddress: null,
      transactionIndex: 0,
      root: '0xb9ca78c288163a322a797ee671db8e9ab430eb00e38c4a989f2246ea22493945',
      gasUsed: BigNumber { _hex: '0x05c3df', _isBigNumber: true },
      logsBloom: '0x00000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000',
      blockHash: '0xb9ca78c288163a322a797ee671db8e9ab430eb00e38c4a989f2246ea22493945',
      transactionHash: '0x1fb19cc0aca8fcccaf5fbafd9174550f3151d0d2aa15d99eb820e0394313e409',
      logs: [
        {
          transactionIndex: 0,
          blockNumber: 4119331,
          transactionHash: '0x1fb19cc0aca8fcccaf5fbafd9174550f3151d0d2aa15d99eb820e0394313e409',
          address: '0x000000000000000000000000000000000000800A',
          topics: [Array],
          ...

    ```

1. Verify that the transaction was successful by running the `display-value` script again.

    ```sh
    npx ts-node ./scripts/display-value.ts
    ```

    You should see an incremented value in the output:

    ```txt
    The counter value is 1
    ```
