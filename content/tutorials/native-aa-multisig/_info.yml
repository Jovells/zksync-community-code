summary: Build a native smart contract account that requires multiple signatures.
description:
  This tutorial will guide you through the process of building a smart contract account that requires two ECDSA
  signatures to execute transactions. We'll create a factory contract that deploys new smart accounts and a multisig
  smart account that can only execute transactions if two signatures are provided.

  - You'll learn how to build a smart contract factory
  - You'll learn how to build a smart contract account
  - You'll learn how to send transactions through a smart contract account
